                                    <p>Bruno was the eldest son in a line of pizza chefs, a talented and passionate young man and very popular with staff and customers.

                                        “People loved Bruno. He was just a lovely young man. He had a sparkle in his eyes that made you feel like it was a party every day of the week.
                                        
                                        “He was just as well liked and respected as anyone I have ever worked with.”
                                        
                                        Bruno and his wife Charlotte, a baker at the bakery, had two children, and started Bruno's as a family business.</p>

                                    <p>The first Bruno's Pizza prided itself on homegrown and handmade, and with it as a foundation, the Bruno franchise has continued to grow.

                                        In 1988, there were one hundred and seven locations.
                                        
                                        Bruno's annual sales at that time totaled $33,000,000.
                                        
                                        At that time, Bruno's CEO Bruno Bucchiarati Jr., son of the founder oversaw many investments into new locations as well as expansion within the markets it served.
                                        
                                        Bruno's has continued to expand over the years, adding locations in places as diverse as India, America, Korea, England, and of course, Italy.
                                        
                                        Bruno's opened the doors to its fifty-fourth franchisee location in Vietnam, where it proudly continue to serve pizza, the Bruno way.</p>
